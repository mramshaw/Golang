Experiments with Go

Go is a fun language but not without eccentricities.

It strikes a nice balance between the "raw metal" and having to know a zillion APIs in order to do anything.

I'm enjoying it quite a lot and I am - on purpose - avoiding multi-threading.

[Multi-threading - and also recursion - can be quite tricky to debug and are definitely advanced topics.
 My personal opinion on recursion is that it should be avoided if at all possible - not always the case,
 I have certainly had to use recursion due to some unusual requirements; on the other hand multi-threading
 has many valid use-cases.]

As far as I can tell, Go was designed for Multi-threading - which is generally pretty tricky stuff.
I'm looking forward to seeing how it handles multi-threading, but first I want to get a good grasp
on the fundamentals.
